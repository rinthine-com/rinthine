# rinthine is not a social network

## Freedom of speech shouldn't be jailed in walled gardens.

Rintine is a set of APIs to allow people share their thoughts with the world. 

The premise is that it will act as an open for all database to allow others to build their social network on.

The principles that Rinthine will operate under are:

- Open source
- Open data
- Not for profit
- No cencorship/moderation, other than abiding to the law
