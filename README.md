The world doesn't really need another Twitter clone, but here we are.

How is this different?

- It's API only
- Free as in free speech; with Open Data everyone has access to all data in the network
- Not for profit
- Implementation on elastic services on AWS
- All posts are public, live forever (minus GDPR compliance)
- If it's legal, it's allowed. Further filtering can be done by third-party integrations. Something like ad-block lists
- Barebones, no DMs, no Cycles, no Verified. Most can again be implemented by third-party lists.
